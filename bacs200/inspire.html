    <h1>An Inspirational Hero</h1>
    <h3>Theodore Roosevelt</h3>
    <p>Someone who I greatly admire and look up to from our nation's past is Theodore Roosevelt. Many only know
        him as the 26th president of the United States, but he was much more than that. Throughout his life Theodore,
        or Teddy, went through much difficulty and faced numerous trials. A couple of examples would be the death of his
        wife
        and mother both occuring on the same day in 1884, and his difficult childhood that was plagued with constant
        sickness.
        Throughout these trials, he persevered and maintained this strong attitude throughout his presidency. His stands
        against
        large corporations/monolopies and creation of countless national parks have left a lasting legacy of this great
        president.
