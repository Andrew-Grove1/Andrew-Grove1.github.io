                    <p>Wealth inequality is one of those issues that has been becoming more and more prevelant within
                        the
                        United States in recent years.
                        Socially, the idea of the elites within society holding onto the majority of the wealth doesn't
                        sit
                        very well with the rest of us. We like things to be fair, and certain people having more than
                        they
                        ever would need while some suffer seems extremely wrong to a lot of us. If social issues were
                        the only issues that faced the United States, then this problem could easily be solved with
                        higher taxes upon the wealthy,
                        but unfortunatly there are many other areas at work within this complex issue regarding wealth.

                    <p>Economically, the issue of wealth inequality is much more difficult to solve. The idea of taking
                        away money from the wealthy business owners leads to many other issues. Many people picture
                        wealthy business owners as sitting around a massive stockpile of money much like Smaug from the
                        Hobbit, but the reality is they use their money to stimulate the economy by creating their
                        businesses, paying wages to workers, and investing into other financial assets. It sounds good
                        in
                        theory to just take the overly wealthy people's money, but would lead to less jobs, higher
                        priced goods, and an overall decrease in economic
                        productivity. In the long run, the average consumer would still end up paying for the money lost
                        by the business whether it be purely from the higher priced products, or in many cases the jobs
                        that used
                        to exist becoming obsolete.</p>

                    <p>Within the political world, wealth inequality has been quite the hot topic. Many politicians have
                        used this idea to pass laws, gain popularity, and even win political elections. There are quite
                        a few differing views on the solutions to this gap in wealth between blue-collar workers and top
                        CEO's or executives. These different solutions aren't always the same between similar
                        viewpoints, and really can differ from politician to politician. We can also expect the topic of
                        wealth inequality to gain even more attention in the upcoming years as more and more attention
                        is being drawn to it. </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    All in all, the issue of wealth inequality isn't going away anytime soon, and will continue to be a
                    major factor in many political decisions in the following years. The social aspect of this issue
                    will continue to be extremely negative while the economic side will continue to be positive. If the
                    world were a fair place, wealth inequality would never arise. However, the world isn't fair, and
                    people are not the same. There are probably many greedy top executives, but the majority of them had
                    less than
                    prosperous years of work in order to get where they got today.
